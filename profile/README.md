# LS-StudyCodes

This is my personal repository for my files that I use for my studies, so there may be repositories with incomplete or messy files and codes, but that's part of the process of growing and learning.
Feel free to clone the repositories and use the code however you like.

**If you like any of the repositories? Leave me a ‚≠ê to help me out!**
